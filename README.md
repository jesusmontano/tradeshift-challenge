## Discussion

This project was bootstrapped with [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 
I chose to use `create-react-app` because it provides a built-in testing environment and a
ready-made application starter, allowing me to start building the application right away without having to deal with Webpack and Babel configurations.

I used [`Tradeshift Elements`](https://github.com/Tradeshift/elements) to build this application's user interface. `Tradeshift Elements` allowed me to integrate reusable Tradeshift UI components into the application, giving it styling that is consistent with the Tradeshift platform.
