## Discussion

This project was bootstrapped with [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 
I chose to use `create-react-app` because it provides a ready-made application starter, meaning I
can start building an app right away without having to deal with Webpack and Babel configurations, as well
as a built-in testing environment.

I used [`Tradeshift Elements`](https://github.com/Tradeshift/elements) to build this application's 
user interface. `Tradeshift Elements` allowed me to integrate reusable Tradeshift UI components into 
my application.
